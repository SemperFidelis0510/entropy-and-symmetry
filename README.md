## Objective

The main objective of this summer project is to investigate the relationship between image textures, entropy measures, and image classification. The project will begin by exploring images with repeating patterns and various symmetries to understand how entropy relates to structured textures. Subsequently, we will apply our knowledge to analyze real-world satellite images of Earth, investigating dependencies on location, time, and zoom levels. Additionally, we will extend our scope to investigate video data, studying the temporal evolution of entropy in moving images. Furthermore, the project will include an analysis of subimages within a larger image to examine patterns of entropy at different scales. This project will provide hands-on experience in Python programming, image processing, and the calculation and application of various entropy measures.

## Stages

### Stage 1: Data Collection - Repeating Patterns

The initial stage will focus on collecting a dataset of images containing repeating patterns with different symmetries. We will use sources like public image repositories or image generation libraries to obtain images with controlled textures. Emphasis will be placed on selecting images with various symmetries, such as rotational, translational, or reflectional symmetries.

### Stage 2: Calculating Image Entropy - Repeating Patterns

In this stage, we will learn about entropy measures and their relevance in the context of repeating patterns. We will explore various entropy calculation methods, such as entropy of the greyscale representation, entropy of the color histogram, and entropy based on different image transformations. The analysis will enable us to investigate how different entropy measures relate to the structured textures present in the repeating patterns.

### Stage 3: Texture Analysis and Classification - Repeating Patterns

Building on the insights gained from the entropy analysis, we will design a texture classification algorithm specific to images with repeating patterns. By setting appropriate entropy thresholds, the algorithm will classify the images based on their structured textures. We will evaluate the classification accuracy and examine how different entropy measures contribute to distinguishing different symmetries and repeating patterns.

### Stage 4: Investigating Videos - Temporal Analysis of Entropy

In this stage, we will expand the project to video data and investigate the temporal evolution of entropy in moving images. We will analyze a collection of video clips and compute various entropy measures over time, exploring how the information content and complexity of images change dynamically. This stage will provide insights into the role of entropy in video analysis and its potential applications.

### Stage 5: Analysis of Real-World Satellite Images

Having gained proficiency in texture analysis and classification, we will proceed to the final stage of the project. We will apply our knowledge and algorithms to analyze real-world satellite images of Earth. The focus will be on studying the textures and patterns present in the satellite images and calculating their entropy using different entropy measures. Additionally, we will investigate the dependencies of entropy on the geographical location, time of acquisition, and zoom levels of the images. This comprehensive analysis will offer valuable insights into the information content of satellite imagery and its spatial and spectral characteristics.

### Stage 6: Subimage Analysis - Examining Entropy Patterns

As an extension of the project, we will investigate the entropy of subimages within a larger image. We will divide the images into smaller, overlapping, or non-overlapping subimages and compute the entropy for each subimage using different entropy measures. By analyzing patterns of entropy at different scales, we will gain a deeper understanding of how image structure and complexity vary within the larger context. This analysis will provide insights into the role of entropy in capturing localized image features.

## Throughout the Project

We will be encouraged to document our progress, insights, and results. Regular meetings will be scheduled to provide guidance, support, and foster collaboration among the students. By investigating repeating patterns, real-world satellite images, temporal video analysis, and subimage entropy patterns using various entropy measures, this project will offer a comprehensive exploration of entropy's role in texture analysis and its application in practical image classification and video analysis scenarios.
